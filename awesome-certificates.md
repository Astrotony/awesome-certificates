# Awesome Certificates Manifesto

- Most IT certifications require payment which makes them inaccessible to many people. 

- There are many free online courses provided but very few of them offer certificates for free.

- This project aims to provide a curated list of free IT certifications in various computer science fields and levels of experience. 

- If you want to contribute to [awesome-certificates](awesome-certificates.md), start with this [guide](contributing.md).

- If you want to to add a course/certificate to this list, open a [pull request](pull_request_template.md).
