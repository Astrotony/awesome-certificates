# The awesome certificates manifesto

Most IT certifications require payment which makes them inaccessible to many people. 

There are many free online courses provided but very few of them offer certificates for free.

This project aims to provide a curated list of free IT certifications in various computer science fields and levels of experience. 

If you want to contribute to [awesome-certificates](awesome-certificates.md), start with this [guide](contribution.md).

If you want to to add a course/certificate to this list, read how to open a [pull request](pull_request.md).
